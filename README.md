## Data access & Structure 
### Dataset information 
The analysis utilizes the Google Analytics sample dataset available in BigQuery:
- Dataset: `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample`
- Table: ga_sessions_*
- Time period: 2017
### Data Schema
For detailed information about the Google Analytics dataset schema, please refer to the official Google Analytics documentation, available at at https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3437719?hl=en â†©
### Data Access Patterns
Key data access patterns include:
- Basic session data: Direct access to ga_sessions_* table
- Product data: Requires UNNEST(hits) and UNNEST(hits.product)
- E-commerce actions: Requires UNNEST(hits) to access eCommerceAction
- Revenue data: Accessed through product.productRevenue after unnesting
## Technical Implementation
The project leverages BigQuery's powerful features including:
- Complex data structures handling through UNNEST operations
- Advanced SQL aggregations and window functions
- Cohort analysis implementation
- Custom metrics calculations (bounce rates, conversion rates, etc.)

## Conclusion
This project has provided valuable insights into consumer behavior in the e-commerce landscape through data analysis using Google Analytics on BigQuery. Key findings include:
- User Engagement: A noticeable increase in page views and transactions, particularly in March 2017, suggests improved user engagement. Ongoing optimization of marketing channels is essential.
- Traffic Source Analysis: Direct traffic has a lower bounce rate compared to other sources, indicating higher user interest. Sources with high bounce rates should be examined for content improvements.
- Product Performance: Variations in revenue and conversion rates among products highlight the need to optimize underperforming items to enhance overall sales.
- Shopping Behavior Patterns: Consumers are increasingly making multiple purchases per session, indicating a positive trend in spending habits.
- Optimization Opportunities: Continuous monitoring of high-performing traffic sources and addressing conversion weaknesses can significantly boost revenue and customer satisfaction.

Overall, these insights lay a foundation for strategic marketing and product development efforts, emphasizing the importance of ongoing data analysis for sustained success in e-commerce.
